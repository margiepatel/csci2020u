Margie Patel (100622787) and Tijauni Carey (100634432)

# Instructions:
Go to https://github.com/margiepatel/csci2020u and then download this repository as a .zip or clone this repository to one of your folders or desktop. Then use a git pull.
For you to run the program, run WebServer.java as an initial and then run Main.java. This will open up a window for you to chose to upload or download the text files.

#What the UPLOAD and DOWNLOAD button do:
The UPLOAD button will facilitate a transfer in the other direction (copying a file from the client’s local shared folder to the server's remote shared folder). As with downloads, the upload will consist of a transfer of every character in the file.

The DOWNLOAD button will cause the file selected in the right list to transfer from the remote server’s shared folder to the local client’s shared folder. This transfer will simply be a copy of every charcter in the file across the net work.
