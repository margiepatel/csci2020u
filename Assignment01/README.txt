To run this program, run Main.java as an initial. This will open up a window for you to chose
your data. There are different ways you can chose to do this, but to run our program you have to click
on the "data" folder once and then click on "open" at bottom-right end of the window. This will take all the data
provided and check for the ham and spam emails. Give it a few seconds so the spam master 3000 can check each
folder. Once the spam master 3000 is done scanning through the folders it will diaplay out a table with
information regarding the emails. The table will show you File, Actual Class and Spam Probability of the emails.
