We can enhance the spam indicator by performing spell checks. In manyspams, there are a considerable measure of
spelling errors. For instance, it would check all the spellings of each word in a spam message, and in excess of
a specific number of words are incorrect, and then it demonstrates that it is a spam message. Performing a spell
check gives a higher opportunity to discover spam in the messages. (run a spell check on the email prior to
classification)

We also can enhance the spam indicator by utilizing an alternate probability strategy that can manage the words.
You can consolidate person probabilities by using p = (p1*p2*p3..pn) / (p1*p2..pn + (1-p1)*(1-p2)....(1-pn).

There are certain words and phrases that make a spam. For instance, emails that contain words such as “free offer”,
“earn cash today” &amp; “lucky winner of a large sum of money”. These phrases are entitled to being a spam. We would
be able to notice these phrases present in the email. This is a form of recognition to help improve spam detecting.

Instead of assuming that each word in an email is independent, you can compute the conditional likelihood of words
occurring in sequence or not.
